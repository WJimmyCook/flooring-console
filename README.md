# Flooring Console App
This is a Java Console App that can create, read, update, and delete flooring orders. The orders are written to files. 
This the first full Java CRUD app I made so it will always hold a special place in my heart.

When adding a new order it is saved to a text file. There is a seperate file for each date.
